# Complete-CPU
For my computer organization and architecture course, I had to design and develop a complete CPU system using VHDL, while integrating a data path, a control unit, and a reset circuit. The purpose of this CPU is to implement the features described in the CPU Specification document. The operation of the CPU was simulated using the Altera Quartus II software (Version 14.0).
