# 4x4 NoC
The purpose of this project is to develop and simulate a Network-on-Chip (NoC) using SystemC. By using the information provided in the [project manual](https://github.com/cthanges/University-Projects/blob/main/4x4-NoC/Project%20Manual.pdf) and understanding the code of the provided 1x2 mesh NoC, a fully-functional 4x4 mesh NoC is developed.

For further information, please refer to the final report: [Final Report](https://github.com/cthanges/University-Projects/blob/main/4x4-NoC/Final%20Report.docx)

This project was developed as part of COE838: Systems-on-Chip Design at Toronto Metropolitan University.
