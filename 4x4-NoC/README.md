# 4x4 NoC
The purpose of this project is to develop and simulate a 4x4 mesh Network-on-Chip (NoC) using SystemC. The NoC consists of routers and IPs that are all provided as code for a 1x2 mesh NoC; specifically the code for the packet structure, source module, sink module, router module, arbiter module, FIFO buffer module, crossbar switch module, and the main simulation module. By understanding and altering the code of the 1x2 mesh NoC, the 4x4 mesh NoC can be created.

This project was developed as part of COE838: Systems-on-Chip Design at Toronto Metropolitan University.
