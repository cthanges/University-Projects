# VGA Video Game Processor (Group Project)
## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a simple video game processor (SVGP) and display it on the VGA monitor. This SVGP consists of Pong, which is achieved by using VHDL within the Xilinx ISE CAD environment to provide instructions for the game's controls, display, and movement. Specifically, the players are controlled by using the LED switches on the Xilinx Spartan-3E FPGA board, the display shown on the VGA monitor is set by taking the horizontal and vertical synchronization signals into consideration, and the ballâ€™s behaviour is determined by how the player or border hits the ball. These were all achieved by following the [Project Manual](https://github.com/cthanges/University-Projects/blob/main/VGA-Video-Game-Processor/Project%20Manual.pdf).
