# Media Center
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive media center using the Keil MCB1700 Evaluation Board and the µVision software. The media center features:
1. A photo gallery that displays bitmap pictures
2. An MP3 player that streams audio from the PC via USB
3. A game center where the user can play a game

These features can all be located via the main menu. The media center's interface is implemented on the LCD and users can to navigate through the system using the MCB1700’s joystick. Creating this media center requires converting the bmp files into C-source arrays to display the images, implementing a USB-based MP3 player with volume control by using the board’s potentiometer, and creating a game environment that uses the LCD and joystick.

This project was developed as part of COE718: Embedded Systems Design at Toronto Metropolitan University.
