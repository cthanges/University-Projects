# Media-Center
For my embedded systems course, I had to create a media center using the Keil MCB1700 evaluation board and the µVision software. This media center features a photo gallery, an MP3 player, and a game, which can all be accessed through the main menu. The media center interface is implemented on the LCD and users can navigate through the system using the board’s built-in joystick.
